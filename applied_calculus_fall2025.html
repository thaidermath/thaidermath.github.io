                    Description: A short, engaging discussion about misconceptions in how AI and human learning differ. Useful for students interested in the broader context of how computational tools interact with learning and problem solving.<br />
                    Suggested audience: All students — watch early in the semester to frame how you use computational tools (e.g., calculators, CAS, and Python) responsibly.

                    <strong>FreeCodeCamp.org — "College Calculus - Full Course with Python Code"</strong><br />
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDFRpjQVaME&list=TLPQMDEwNTIwMjWB60KdEXYV7w&index=14" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch on YouTube — FreeCodeCamp.org (full course)</a><br />
                    Description: A full-length, lecture-style playlist that teaches calculus with Python examples. Good for students who want a slower-paced, worked-example approach and extra practice implementing ideas in code.<br />
                    Suggested audience: Students looking for extra practice and those who plan to use Python for assignments or projects.
