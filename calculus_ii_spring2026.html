                    Description: Derek Muller looks at how AI could change teaching and learning, using lessons from past technology changes and key ideas from cognitive science. AI brings exciting possibilities, but it also creates real risks, especially for how we develop knowledge and skills.<br />
                    Suggested audience: All students. It’s best to watch this early in the semester.
